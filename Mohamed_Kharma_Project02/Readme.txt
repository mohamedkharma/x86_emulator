NAME: Mohamed Kharma
Project 02

In this assignment, we were asked to build a Calender. The way my Calender works is that it display a full 
year of 2021 to the user starting by January of 2021 and until December 2021. 

The user can control and chnage between the months using the 'n' and 'p' buttons on his keyborad. 
N for next.
P for previous.
Note: The characters need to be low captial for it to work.

Lastly, 
- The program is a full screen application.
- For Output, the program uses video memory (seg 0xB800).
- For Input, the program uses int 16h.
- To make the program look presentable, colors and line draw characters are used.
- User can navigate between months and different screens.
- I worked on this project on my own and used the notes and google to learn and research everything written.
